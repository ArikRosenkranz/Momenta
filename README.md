# Momenta

Momenta is a repairable and customisable video camera that motivates more conscious filming. Inspired by the point-and-shoot concept of analogue photography, it enables video recording without a screen, leaving the moment undisturbed. The minimalist electronics make Momenta compact and easy to carry, so you can take it anywhere.Â The recordings focus on capturing memories in an authentic atmosphere. A network enables the exchange of functions and further developments and also provides a platform for content.

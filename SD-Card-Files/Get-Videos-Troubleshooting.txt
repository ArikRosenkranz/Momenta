Troubleshooting Guide for Startup Issues: Get-Videos.command

If the script does not start when double-clicked, macOS may be blocking the file. In this case:

1. Open the Terminal (e.g., via Spotlight by pressing ⌘ + Space and typing “Terminal”).
2. Copy the following command into the Terminal:

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Volumes/MOMENTA/Get-Videos.command

3. Press the Return key.
4. This will remove the quarantine flag, and the script should then work as expected.
